##### Explain On What Does Microprocessor Speed Depend?

The processing speed depends on `DATA BUS WIDTH`.
Factors on which the Processor speed depends:

- Processor clock speed
- Processor pipelining
- Width of the data and address bus, i.e. Max Data that can be fetched at one stretch.
- Support for floating point operations for faster floating point operations.
